                <span id="titlereference">moodtracks.app</span> is a free web application to find your top tracks for each mood. You can generate a playlist
                based on your top moodtracks for the past week, month, 6 months, or all time! You will be given an image that you can share to social media
                and also an option to create a playlist based on the moodtracks generated.

            <p id="description">
                This tool uses Spotify's API to classify each song based on properties like "Energy" or "Dancability". To get this data
                from Spotify, log in into your Spotify account, I don't collect any information! All log in information is handled by
                Spotify themselves.

            <p id="description">
                I have always wanted to build a tool for Spotify but I did not know how to, especially after using the amazing web app, Receiptify.
                That said, I recently graduated from college and wanted to put my programming skills to the test so I decided to give it a go. 
                You can personally look at this website's code on my github profile!
