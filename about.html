                <span id="titlereference">moodtracks.me</span> is a free web application to find cool facts 
                about the music you listen to and way more. You can find your top 10 tracks. You can 
                learn what are some of your most unique songs. You can find out what songs you listen to based on a mood.
                You can even use this tool to create journaling playlists!

                All music data is structured with sharing in mind. Share it on social media or send it to a friend. Print it as a scrapbook item or tape it to your shoes. 
                You can even show it to your pets if you'd like but I don't think they would make much sense of it.

                Journaling? With Music? 
            </h1>
            <p id="description">
                I like to make a monthly playlist of the songs that were in my rotation. It is fun to look back at what I was listening to at the time
                and simply makes it a fun journaling project. It lets me look back at my moods and what I was really into. With moodtracks, you can do this way quicker.
                All music fact points can be made into a playlist for your Spotify library, just press Add to Library!

                In 2020, there was this website called Receiptify - which is still up - that put your top songs in a form of a receipt. I have always liked this tool and wanted to build something similar.
                Fortunately for you, (unfortunately for me), I have been struggling to find a software engineering job so to keep my programming skills sharp and add more stuff to my resume,
                I decided to build a powerful web application and thus, moodtracks was born.
                <br><br>
                As for me, I am simply a recent college grad with a passion for programming. Please feel free to reach out to me in the contact page! Maybe I put my Instagram here sometime.

                Spotify's API (Application Programming Interface) is the only music streaming API that gives me access to cool data like how 'dancable' a song is, which is what
                I use for this tool. This type of data is not available on other music providers.
