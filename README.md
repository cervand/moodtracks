# moodtracks.app
moodtracks.app is a small web application that gathers your favorite songs for a specific mood using Spotify's API. This project is meant to review my HTML and CSS knowledge. I also want to learn how to apply my API knowledge using Javascript

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used (Expected)
- Figma
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

## ü§î Why didn't you use a framework?
For one single reason! I wanted to test myself on CSS, HTML, and Javascript. It usually makes more sense to use a framework for web development, but I figured I would appreciate them more after diving deep into making everything from scratch. Plus, my website should be able to load only the resources it needs. Nonetheless, for my next web project (my personal website) I definitely plan on using some frameworks like bootstrap and react. 

## üß© Where is the rest of the code?
In order to protect my personal tokens for using the Spotify API, I decided to not upload any code related to it to protect any users that may use my site and myself. If you are here because you want to clone my repo and work on it, check out Spotify's Web App API tutorial, I basically have the same code as that. 

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
- Create basic UI as shown above using HTML and CSS ‚úÖ
- Implement responsive web design to current UI ‚úÖ
- Implement Spotify API to get top songs based on track features ‚úÖ
- Create generated images ‚úÖ
- Add ability to download images
