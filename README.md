# moodtracks.app
moodtracks.app is a small web application that gathers your favorite songs for a specific mood using Spotify's API. This project is meant to review my HTML and CSS knowledge. I also want to learn how to apply my API knowledge using Javascript

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Figma
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

## 🤔 Why didn't you use a framework?
For one single reason! I wanted to test myself on CSS, HTML, and Javascript. It usually makes more sense to use a framework for web development, but I figured I would appreciate them more after diving deep into making everything from scratch. 

Now that I have finished this project, I realize how useful React is and styling libraries like Bootstrap are. 

## 🛣️ Roadmap
- Create basic UI as shown above using HTML and CSS ✅
- Implement responsive web design to current UI ✅
- Implement Spotify API to get top songs based on track features ✅
- Create generated images ✅
- Add ability to download images (On it! I am thinking of using HTML2Canvas)
